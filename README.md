## App Systemizer (Terminal Emulator)
[More info and details in the XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-terminal-app-systemizer-ui-t3585851)

 Systemize your App systemlessly!
 Using terminal emulator.
 Enter this command and choose the app you want to systemize.

	systemize
	
 And you will be presented with a list of installed apps.
 And Reboot to apply changes.

## Error?
 Go to the menu and type `logs`, this will upload the log files of this module and will generate a link. Send that :)
 Alternatively, Send `/cache/terminal_debloater-verbose.log` in the XDA thread. I'll examine it for problems and will try to fix it.
